## User Design

### Strategy
* With the main goal for this app to allow users to simply plan future trips to Northern Ireland National Trust sites, 
  aesthetically pleasing and relevant imagery will allow the user to focus on the content, without being distracted. 
  The design of the site needs to complement the content it is delivering. 
* The 'Home' page allows users to read a small consise text box describing the purpose of this app. 
* This website is aimed at users who want to be aware of the experiences the National Trust has to offer in Northern Ireland. 
  There is no pressure to pursue these attractions. Moreover, there are different types of attractions to suit different types of potential users. The Google Map feature allows users to view the sites on an interactive map.
* The weather widget allows users to view the weather for upcoming visits that have been planned. 

### Scope
* Responsive website for any viewing device size.
* Responsive and interactive navigation bar.
* Relevant images showing some sites mentioned on the app and useful information accompanying the attraction.
* Implementation of API's to display information to the user.
* Producing and interactive website with clickable features that allow the user to find further information about the different attractions.
* Internal page links that allow the user to navigate the website efficiently.
* User authentication to enure that users have there own personal planner for upcoming trips.

#### Future Scope
**Potential for future implementation**
* An 'About' section.
* A seciton that allows past visitors to the mentioned sites to leave reviews.
* For the app not to be contained to just Northern Ireland.
* An interactive blog or newsletter.
* The ability for users to 'favourite' the sites they enjoyed most.
* A checklist of sites that have been visited that specific user
* a seperate list for all user visits and another list for a specific users planned visits.

### Structure

    * Simple title with navigation in header. This will be responsive and across all pages of website.

### Design

#### Color Scheme
* The color of the scheme of the site was decided by using natural green colors that can be easily associated with a Northern Ireland and the National Trust.
* The color of #004d40, complements the main and overall color dervived from the app theme. This color is strong and allows text to be easily read. 
* Where suitable the color black was used for text against a white background, these are contrasting colors that allow the user to easily read the information.
* With a neutral background color, the information depicted would not be too contrasting on the site when loaded.  

#### Typography
* The font utilised for this app was the Montserrat font. Thia font has the serif typeface, therefore Sans Serif will be used as the fallback font in case there is an issue when importing the fonts, or browsers not supporting these. Font was imported via Google Fonts completement the simplicity of the design giving a visually pleasing user experience.

#### Imagery
* Images used purely for some asthetically pleasing design.  
* Font icons will be used throughout the website imported from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
  These will be used to further emphasise the different sections of the website. 
  Using these icons adds a simple, effective and a subtle touch to the site that allows the user to understand what each section relates to. 
  The icons will be relevant to the different section headings of the site.
